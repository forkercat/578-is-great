## Project Description

In our third homework, we applied two recovery techniques to Tomcat and recovered Tomcat's architectures in the form of clusters. However, these techniques are not very suitable to analyze the security of a system from an architecture perspective (e.g. some techniques cannot cluster components of an architectural decision together).

In this project, we modify the existing techniques in `ARCADE` and turn them into "security-aware" versions. Specifically, given a security-related architectural decision, our refined techniques can put all its components into a cluster.

**Our Subject System:** Apache Tomcat 8.5.47

## Summary of What We Did

- Read source code of Tomcat, and understand how Tomcat works.
- Pick security-related vulnerabilities, analyze if they are suitable for this project.
- Know how relevant components work and why the vulnerabilities occur and how they affect the system.
- Show that original techniques fail in discovering the vulnerabilities.
- Analyze source code in `ARCADE` and understand how `ACDC` and `ARC` work.
- Develop solutions that improve the techniques, write many comments, and make output more readable.🙄
- Use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create visualizations (super cool).


## Before We Start

Setting up [ARCADE](https://github.com/asejfia/CS578-arcade) in our working environment is extremely hard. Since we would re-compile source files for many times, we open the project files in IntelliJ IDEA. And yes... it took us few days to make it work.

So if you want to run our code, you can follow these steps:

- Clone our this repository to your local directory by `git clone git@github.com:junhaowww/578-is-great.git` .
- Since the project is so large, we separate Tomcat and some library files from our repository.
  - Download Tomcat [source files]() (it is compiled, no worry), unzip, and put the folder `src` in `578-is-great/tomcat`.
  - Download [library files](), unzip, and put them in `578-is-great/CS578-arcade`.
- Open `578-is-great/CS578-arcade` with IntelliJ IDEA (`.idea` exists, do not re-create).
- Enjoy:)

Other Tools We Used:

## Major Task

Link: [Tomcat 8.x Vulnerabilities](http://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html)

### Security Decision #1 (System Property Disclosure)

Vulnerability ID: [CVE-2016-6794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6794)

This was fixed in revision [1754726](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1754726) for 8.5.x. Open it to see which files are related.

#### Function Description

<!-- 设计到哪些类和大概的功能 -->
This security decision is related to several classes including `WebappClassLoaderBase`, `PermissionCheck`, `Digester`.

`WebappClassLoader` is a shared class loader. When Tomcat loads an app, `WebappClassLoaderBase` will create `Digester` to parse XML files and use `Digester` to create and set up other components like Server, Connector, Container, etc.

`PermissionCheck` is an interface implemented by `WebappClassLoaderBase`. It will be used for permission check when a `Digester` object calls the method `getProperty()`.

In previous versions, there is no `PermissionCheck`, so the code is as follows:

```java
// Digester.java
@Override
public String getProperty(String key) {
  return System.getProperty(key);
}
```

![Code](https://bloggg-1254259681.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/sv36i.png "Code")


#### Vulnerability Description

<!-- 安全缺陷的描述（要自己写, 加引用） -->
There is a method `getProperty()` in `Digester` class. In old versions, this method will simply call System.`getProperty()` and return the result.

It is possible that a malicious app could get a `Digester` object. Then this app could call the `getProperty()` through the newly created digester object and get system properties that should be invisible to him.

#### How It Was Fixed

<!-- PermissionCheck的原理 -->
Tomcat added an interface named `PermissionCheck` and the `WebappClassLoaderBase` implemented the `check()` method stated in `PermissionCheck` interface.

Then tomcat modified the `getProperty()` method in `Digester` class. 

When this method is called, it will firstly find the class loader of this app through `Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()`. 

Then it'll check if this class loader is a `WebAppClassLoaderBase`. If so, the digester will call the `check()` method implemented by the classloader to check if he is granted to visite system properties. If the digester cannot pass the permission check, this method will simply return null. If the digester passes the permission check, this method will call `System.getProperty()` and return the its result.

```java
@Override
public String getProperty( String key ) {
    ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    if (cl instanceof PermissionCheck) {
        Permission p = new PropertyPermission(key, "read");
        if (!((PermissionCheck) cl).check(p)) {
            return null;
        }
    }
    return System.getProperty(key);
}
```

### Security Decision #2 (JREPlatform.java)

#### Function Description

<!-- 设计到哪些类和大概的功能 -->
This security decision is related to classes including `AbstractFileResourceSet` and `JrePlatform`.

The `AbstractFileResourceSet` is used to get the file identified by a URL.

The `JrePlatform` is used to check whether the tomcat is running on windows.

![](https://bloggg-1254259681.cos.na-siliconvalley.myqcloud.com/xj9uh.png)

#### Vulnerability Description

<!-- 安全缺陷的描述（要自己写, 加引用） -->
It's possible that a user upload a JSP file through HTTP PUT and that JSP file could be executed later.

In this case, if the URL of that JSP file does not meet the requirement of the server's platform environment, like windows, an error could rise and the tomcat might crash.


#### How It Was Fixed

<!-- JrePlatform的原理 -->
Tomcat added another class named `JrePlatform` to solve this problem.

Another component is introduced when fetching a file through URL. The `AbstractFileResourceSet` will fetch the IS_WINDOWS variable, which would be initialized through the static method in `JrePlatform` when this class is being loaded.

Then the `AbstractFileResourceSet` will check if the current platform is windows. If so, the `AbstractFileResourceSet` will use windows directory naming rule to check the URL passed in. If the validation does pass, `AbstractFileResourceSet` will simply return null. If the validation passes, the AbstractResourceSet will fetch the real file.

```java
if (JrePlatform.IS_WINDOWS && isInvalidWindowsFilename(name)) {
	return null;
}
```
